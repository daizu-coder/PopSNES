 * Custom ROM picker (CE/ce_res.rc's IDD_FILEOPEN) - a directory-browsing

 * earlier prototype's own IDD_FILEOPEN/DLGFileOpen (in its source): the
 * standard common file-open dialog has no way to render Japanese folder/
 * file names on this device (its own font is glyph-less for them,
 * confirmed by the earlier prototype's dev notes, and unfixable via OFN_* flags), so
 * the earlier prototype replaced it outright with a self-drawn listbox using the bundled
 * Japanese font (see ce_lang.h) instead.
