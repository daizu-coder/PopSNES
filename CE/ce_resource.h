/* Touch-to-reveal "menu" dialog (CE/ce_res.rc's IDD_MAINMENU): plain
 * DialogBoxW + PUSHBUTTON controls, not a real HMENU - this coredll
 * genuinely does not export SetMenu (checked with nm; CreateMenu/
 * AppendMenuW/DrawMenuBar exist but SetMenu/GetMenu don't - a real
 * limitation of this CE profile, not a mistake), and the Pocket-PC-style
 * alternative (SHCreateMenuBar) is both a different visual paradigm
 * (bottom command bar, not a desktop-style dropdown) and an unverified
 * fit for this CE profile. DialogBox is proven on this exact
 * hardware already (GetOpenFileNameW, the previous CE project's own
 * settings screens).
 *
 * Layout matches an earlier prototype's IDD_MAINMENU control-for-
 * control (same rects, same 210x140 dialog size): Open ROM full width
 * (WS_GROUP - the one thing that makes Up/Down *wrap* at the first/last
 * button on this device, plain sequential move already works without
 * it), Save/Load State as a 2-up row, the three config dialogs as a
 * 3-up row (in the same left-to-right slot the earlier prototype's Misc/Sound/Keys
 * occupy - Video Cfg is this project's "Misc" analogue, it's where the
 * language toggle lives, same reasoning as IDC_VC_JAPANESE below), Exit
 * full width, and a footer hint line instead of a separate Resume
 * button/About button - resuming is just the physical Back key
 * (IDCANCEL), matching the earlier prototype exactly. */
